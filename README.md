# Fridericus - Your personal space on the web

Fridericus is a continuously developing front-end layout, very useful for starting to learn the basics of web development. It is very simple and structured with the implementation of the famous bootstrap framework in its third version.

The layout in its entirety has a section for:
- a short description
- communicate your skills
- a carousel where to exhibit your work
- a very simple contact form
- and much more...
